# Dotfiles

These are the dotfiles that I use.

I highly recommend using the Thoughtbot laptop & dotfiles to get started.

* [thoughtbot/laptop](https://github.com/thoughtbot/laptop)
* [thoughtbot/dotfiles](https://github.com/thoughtbot/dotfiles)

You'll find my dotfiles hook into their configuration.
