# Dotfiles

These are the dotfiles that I use.

I highly recommend using the Thoughtbot laptop & dotfiles to get started.

* (thoughtbot/laptop)[https://github.com/thoughtbot/laptop]
* (thoughtbot/dotfiles)[https://github.com/thoughtbot/dotfiles]

You'll find my dotfiles hook into their configuration.
